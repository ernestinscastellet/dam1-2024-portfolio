## CSS group:

### Summary
>We managed to add that Bootstrap thing, we also changed the **header**'s color to a light-gray, also we added both CSS: the bootstrap and ours. We made the list look better, at least the **full page responsive** so it changes when you're looking at it from a mobile device. We made the padding bigger from the bootstrap. We also added an Icon to the page. We fixed the header position so it won't change.

### DEPLOYMENT GROUP

>After seeing several ways to publish the website, we found the most efficient way. First you access the repository settings. Second we access the "Page" section. Thirdly, we fill in the necessary data requested to open the website. Fourth, we wait for it to be ready and check to see that everything is correct.
