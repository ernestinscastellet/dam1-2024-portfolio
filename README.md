## CSS group:

### Summary
>We managed to add that Bootstrap thing, we also changed the **header**'s color to a light-gray, also we added both CSS: the bootstrap and ours. We made the list look better, at least the **full page responsive** so it changes when you're looking at it from a mobile device. We made the padding bigger from the bootstrap. We also added an Icon to the page. We fixed the header position so it won't change.
